# Election-Eligibility-Check
  
                                   CS50X Final Project


This is my final project for the conclusion of the CS50 
"Introduction to Computer Science Course".

This project is basically related to the algorithm which evaluates
either particular person is eligible to cast the vote 
in the election or not.


Real life benefit of using this software
 
•	Save the cost of printing voter card
•	Users friendly
•	Can easily run in every model
•	Can verify the person digitally

Features
	Python
I have used the algorithms based on the python programming to generally identity the viable candidate.




Explaining the project 

My final project is the algorithm that allow the user to know either they are eligible to cast the vote in upcoming election or not. Generally, to use it is quite easy just the user has to click the run button and of course python should be installed in their computer.


Steps involved:
1.	First it will ask you to select the country of origin, you can select the one.
2.	Next, it will ask the country of citizenship you have. Since I have prepared it for the election of Nepal, so you have to write Nepal.
3.	Then, it will ask for your first name, last name and your gender you have to provide the authentic details.
4.	Next, it will ask your date of birth in BS if it shows your age is below 18 then a popup message will be notified saying you are under age so you are not eligible to cast the vote, but if your age is above 18 you will be directed to next question.
5.	Following the previous question it will ask for your citizenship number due to the legal reason citizenship number ‘1111111111’, ‘2222222222’, ‘4444444444’, ‘5555555555’ and ‘6666666666’ are only added to the algorithms so if you list other citizenship number then it will say “Please provide correct information”. Else, it will notify you “you are eligible along with voter id number.
Note: If you are feeling uncomfortable to count the above-mentioned citizenship number, you don’t need to count each digit is repeated 10 times.


## While filling the date of birth you will fill such date which results in your age less than or equal to 0 or age that is above 140 yrs., Error message will be pop-up.

About CS50
CS50 is a openware course from Havard University and taught by David J. Malan
Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, and software engineering. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus students’ choice of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development).
Thank you for all CS50.
